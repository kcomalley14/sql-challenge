# sql-challenge

The SQL challenge allowed us to break into a relational database to query data from large datasets. This homework, in its simpler queries, really helped grasp the understanding of how powerful the SQL database is. The ability to match different data tables together with simple functions, but not altering the overall data, is very versatile. Keeping certain data secure is also important in almost every business, so SQL will allow tables to be joined from keys to combine data when needed, but is not listed in a larger, public dataset.

Through the sql-challenge homework, I was able to successfully engineer an ERD that creates tables for all of the csv files that need to be imported. Then the data analysis can begin, where we answered the following questions.

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
